# CMI-resources

This repository contains lecture-notes, assignments, past question papers and other miscellany from courses taught at CMI. I have also scraped Agnishom's directory which contains various resources for the courses that he took. There is some overlap between the courses that we have taken (Complexity, LPCO) so you migh find some extra material in his folder.  

In case you have some of the [missing papers](https://github.com/bhi5hmaraj/CMI-resources/blob/master/Question-Papers/Missing.md) or want to contribute, please let [me](mailto:bhishma@cmi.ac.in) know or create a PR !
