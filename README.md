# CMI-resources

This repository contains lecture-notes, assignments, past question papers and other miscellany from courses taught at CMI. I have also scraped Agnishom's directory which contains various resources for the courses that he took.  

In case you have some of the [missing papers](https://github.com/bhi5hmaraj/CMI-resources/blob/master/Question-Papers/Missing.md) or want to contribute, please let [me](mailto:bhishma@cmi.ac.in) know or create a PR !
